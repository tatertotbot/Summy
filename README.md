# Summy
Repo for a discord bot that summarizes long discord conversations

As of right now this only will summarize the last 25 messages. It shouldn't be too hard to make this customizable and easier to use, so I will likely make this better in the future.

Usage(for your own bot):
1. Add your own .env file where it contains a variable called "BOTTOKEN" which is the token of the discord bot
2. Add another variable to this file called "OPENAIKEY" where it is what you think it is, an openai key
3. Run the python file and start using it wherever you put your discord bot

**NOTE** you will only be able to comprehend these instructions ^ if you know how to make a discord bot
